Why Dask?\n","\n","When analyzing data from hundreds of air quality stations spanning multiple years, a pure‑Pandas approach may exceed memory limits or run very slowly. By deferring execution and parallelizing operations, [Dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/) preserves an interactive experience similar to pandas while distributing computations efficiently. Specifically, Dask enables us to:\n","- **Scale out** computations across multiple cores or a cluster\n","- **Partition** large tables into manageable chunks\n","- Work with familiar APIs such as `DataFrame`, `Bag`, and `Delayed`. Each API constructs **a lazy execution graph** that you trigger with `.compute()` or `.persist()`. This design enables out-of-core processing and parallelism. More details can be found at https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/overview.html."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3c00f0df","metadata":{"id":"3c00f0df"},"source":["| API           | Use Case                                 | Key Methods                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n","| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n","| **DataFrame** | Handles tabular operations (diff, groupby, join) | [`.read_csv()`, `.map_partitions()`](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/dataframe-api.html#dask.dataframe.DataFrame.map_partitions), `.compute()`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n","| **Bag**       | Manages unstructured collections (transactions)  | [`.to_bag()`](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/generated/dask.dataframe.to_bag.html), [`.map()`](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/bag-api.html#dask.bag.Bag.map), [`.flatten()`](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/bag-api.html#dask.bag.Bag.flatten), [`.frequencies()`](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/bag-api.html#dask.bag.Bag.frequencies), [`.fold()`](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/bag-api.html#dask.bag.Bag.fold) |\n","| **Delayed**   | Builds custom task graphs for arbitrary Python functions                       | `dask.delayed`, `.compute()`, `.persist()`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e4b84296","metadata":{"id":"e4b84296"},"source":["                                                                        \n","                                       \n","\n","\n","\n","### Dependencies"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"d4c964b8","metadata":{"id":"d4c964b8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1758649516292,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":8340,"user":{"displayName":"Peter Zhang","userId":"01014316854815802369"}},"outputId":"34307d69-8746-43b6-e75e-1d4c77a8eb4d","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[?25l   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m0.0/52.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m?\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m-:--:--\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m52.0/52.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m3.8 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h\u001b[?25l   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m0.0/1.3 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m?\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m-:--:--\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m1.3/1.3 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m59.0 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h"]}],"source":["%pip install -q dask[complete] dask-jobqueue"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"e166e81d","metadata":{"id":"e166e81d"},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","\n","from dask_jobqueue import SLURMCluster\n","from dask.distributed import Client\n","\n","import dask.dataframe as dd"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1cf4e010","metadata":{"id":"1cf4e010"},"source":["## 2.

Specifically, you'll identify which station's PM₂.₅ increase might be a precursor to another's. This can help generate hypotheses about pollution transport pathways or shared atmospheric conditions.\n","\n","### **From Itemsets to Rules**\n","\n","An association rule takes the form $X \\rightarrow Y$, where $X$ (the **antecedent**) and $Y$ (the **consequent**) are non-empty itemsets that have no items in common. To evaluate the strength of a rule, we use two key metrics:\n","\n","* **Confidence**: The probability of seeing itemset $Y$, given we see itemset $X$, measuring the reliability of a rule:\n","\n","    $$\n","    \\text{Confidence}(X \\rightarrow Y) = \\frac{\\text{support}(X \\cup Y)}{\\text{support}(X)}\n","    $$\n","\n","* **Lift**: Measures how much more likely $X$ and $Y$ are to co-occur than if they were independent. **lift > 1** suggests a positive correlation, making the rule more interesting than random chance.\n","\n","    $$\n","    \\text{Lift}(X \\rightarrow Y) = \\frac{\\text{support}(X \\cup Y)}{\\text{support}(X) \\times \\text{support}(Y)}\n","    $$\n","\n","### **Your Task**\n","\n","Now, you'll generate rules from **all** the frequent itemsets you discovered (`freq_itemsets`), not just pairs.\n","\n","1.  **Iterate Through Frequent Itemsets**: Loop through each level in your `freq_itemsets` list, starting from itemsets of size 2.\n","\n","2.  **Generate Candidate Rules**: For each frequent itemset `I`, you need to generate all possible rules. This involves splitting `I` into an antecedent `X` and a consequent `Y`.\n","    * For a given frequent itemset `I`, find all of its non-empty, proper subsets. Each of these subsets can serve as an antecedent `X`.\n","    * The consequent `Y` is simply the set of items in `I` that are not in `X`.\n","    * For example, if `{A, B, C}` is a frequent itemset, you would generate rules like $\\{A\\} \\rightarrow \\{B, C\\}$, $\\{B\\} \\rightarrow \\{A, C\\}$, $\\{C\\} \\rightarrow \\{A, B\\}$, $\\{A, B\\} \\rightarrow \\{C\\}$, and so on.\n","\n","3.  **Calculate Confidence and Lift**: For each generated rule $X \\rightarrow Y$, calculate its confidence and lift. You will need the support values for the itemsets `X`, `Y`, and their union `X` $\\cup$ `Y` (which is the original itemset `I`).\n","\n","4.  **Filter and Interpret**: Collect all the generated rules into a pandas DataFrame. Filter them based on meaningful thresholds (e.g., `confidence > 0.7`, `lift > 1.2`) and analyze the results. Do more complex rules (with more items) provide deeper insights into pollution dynamics?\n","\n","\n","## **Bonus Challenge: Introduce a Time Lag**\n","\n","The current model only looks at same-day increases. A more powerful analysis would be to see if an increase at a station *today* predicts an increase at another station **tomorrow**.\n","\n","Modify the initial transaction creation process to test this hypothesis.
